---

Team-agile provides an API for managing team tasks.

## Reasons

This project was started for:

- Hobby/pet project. It's a place for my experiments outside my day job.
- Education. I explore and practice Go for Web technologies there.

## Contribute

I hope you're as excited about Go as I am, so you're welcome to collaborate, chat about technology, or discuss the wonders of Go!

Please help make this project better with your contribution. Your review, feature, code sample, or discussion of best practices would help us become better engineers!

Please explore some [suggestions](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute.
